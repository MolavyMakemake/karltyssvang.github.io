    I am a postgraduate student at the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a>, University of Oxford. 
    I will commence my PhD this October as part of the ERC starting project <b>GeoFEM (Geometric Finite Elements)</b> 
    with <a href="https://kaibohu.github.io">Prof. Kaibo Hu</a> as my primary advisor, and 
    <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/math/personer/vit/snorrec/">Prof. Snorre H. Christiansen</a> as my secondary advisor.

    My academic background is in differential geometry and functional analysis, which is
    complemented by an extensive experience with programing. I am curious about how
    we can represent and discretize geometries and PDE (partial differential equations) on
    computers, and of how the two relate. For example, if you have a PDE on a sphere should
    you discretize the sphere before discretizing the PDE? We can approach such questions
    using tools from the fields of <b>discrete differential geometry</b> and <b>finite elements methods</b>.

    I obtained my MSc in applied mathematics at the University of Oslo in 2025. My thesis <a href="https://www-duo-uio-no.ezproxy.uio.no/handle/10852/120887">Non-Euclidean Elements</a> was on structure preserving
    discretizations of PDE in the hyperbolic spaces. In this context the philosophy of virtual element methods was an
    important tool for dealing with the underlying geometry in an intrinsic manner. I believe  the computational restrictions 
    which arrise in dealing with an underlying metric can inspire further development of established element methods.
